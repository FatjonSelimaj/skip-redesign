# Skip Selector Redesign â€“ WeWantWaste

This is a complete redesign of the **"Choose Your Skip Size"** page from [wewantwaste.co.uk](https://wewantwaste.co.uk), rebuilt using **React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS** for improved code quality, UX, and mobile responsiveness.

---

## ðŸš€ Objective

âœ… Rebuild the page in React, keeping all core functionality but with:

- A fresh, modern and accessible UI
- Clean and maintainable code structure
- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop
- Dynamic data fetching from a public API
- Visual feedback when a skip is selected

---

## ðŸ§© Tech Stack

- **React** (with Vite and TypeScript)
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Axios** for data fetching
- API used:  
  `https://app.wewantwaste.co.uk/api/skips/by-location?postcode=NR32&area=Lowestoft`

---

## ðŸ“¦ Project Structure

```

src/
â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx                # Main entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ SkipList.tsx       # Handles fetching & listing skips
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ SkipCard.tsx       # Visual representation of a skip
â”œâ”€â”€ types/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ skip.ts            # TypeScript interface for Skip data

````

---

## ðŸ’¡ Approach

- On load, `SkipList` fetches data from the `by-location` API using Axios.
- The response is strictly typed via a custom `Skip` interface.
- Each skip is rendered via the `SkipCard` component, displaying:
  - Skip size, hire period, pre-VAT price, total price, and road eligibility
- A selected skip is highlighted with a green border and "Selected âœ“" button
- Road-ineligible skips are marked with a red warning tag
- Grid layout is responsive using Tailwindâ€™s `grid-cols` utilities
- Includes full loading / error / empty state handling
